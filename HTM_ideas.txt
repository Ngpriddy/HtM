CHALLENGE 1
Given 13 aircraft with known wire issues, identify:
  - list of maintenance actions that fixed the issues
  - list of MSP codes for each maintenance action that fixed the issue

HINT 1: Intermittent MSP codes related to the issue likey stopped after the repair.
  - If we know when the repair occured, we can plot out the occurances of the
    error codes vs. time and identify (visually) which error codes were
    associated with the issue
  - Conversely, if we can identify when unusual error codes suddenly stopped
    occuring, we can reference the timestamps on the MAF to identify which
    actions were taken around the same time to better understand which actions
    could have fixed the issue
  
HINT 2: Some aircraft have clusters of wiring related MAFs and the same MSP codes can be
correctly attributed to more than one MAF.
  - If we identify the MSP codes associated with one wiring-related MAF, we can
    take that same string of codes and do a sliding dot product
    (cross-correlation) across the entire time-series of MSP codes to try and
    identify if that same pattern occurs elsewhere in the data
  - Or just do string matching on a sequence of values... That's less fancy but
    much easier

HINT 3: Some aircraft had more than one wiring inspection
  - No thoughts on this

"You may provide up to 200 maintenance actions as part of your solution. Additionally, 
you can provide up to 10 MSP codes for each maintenance action"
  - 2000 MSP code max for our submission

"There is a challenge 1 submission spreadsheet template in the participant materials."
  - Anyone know where this is?
